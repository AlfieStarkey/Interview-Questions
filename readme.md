# Light & Wonder Maths Interview Question
## Question 1 Part 3

This python script prompts for an input of attempts to run the slot machine game checking for 8 X symbols in a 3x3 slot machine window. The slot reels are randomised and within each reel is a sequence of 3 consecutive X symbols. The script outputs the number of successful attempts alongside the number of trials with the first instance of success in list form.
