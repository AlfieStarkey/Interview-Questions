# Light & Wonder Maths Interview Question
## Question 1 Part 3

This was my means of checking my work in a way that was relevant to the job description.

I had a couple of issues with the values it was providing, showing ~50x the calculated 1/36000. The issue ended up being where the break was within the function definition of simulate attempts where it was an extra indent away from where it needed to be. 

I was unsure whether or not the list needed to wrap such that landing on the final value of the reel would check the first 2 of the reel. I think with more time I would have implimented that also for completions sake.
